This is a little script that checks the FoC web page for changes.

Because we're right at the start of the year, I wouldn't be surprised
if there are updates to the page (some of the tutorial sheets are
marked for 2017, for instance).

But having my own local copy of that page is useful; so I want to
have a way of (a) keeping it in sync and (b) being notified when
something has changed and what exactly has changed.
